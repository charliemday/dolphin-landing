If you know me, you know I’m a big believer in the power of live events to communicate, drive action, or promote a change of behaviour.

Sometimes events are about networking, sometimes about sharing a message. Sometimes about celebrating. But most of all, it’s about bringing people together. You just can’t replace this.

That’s exactly what we did on July 18th, 2024. We brought together a bunch of super clever and experienced people in tech, with an even more interesting mix of participants to join us for our first-ever in-person event hosted by Dolphin with [Intel Ignite](https://intelignite.com/), [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/en-GB), and [Seedlegals](https://seedlegals.com/).

### The Power of Live Events

We’ve always been super close to others in the industry. And a big part of our WHY for building a startup is to add value to the whole ecosystem, beyond the product we are building. 

Whether that is through our customers, partners, or just by developing a sense of community, we always think about giving first.

We’re not the type of startup that will lock itself in a room for 9 months coding, and then ship once a year 🙅‍♂️.

We’re the scrappy team that will ship daily, and talk to users weekly, to help steer the direction of our product. As long as it aligns with our vision, **feedback is king** 🐬.

So what was this event about? You guessed it… Customer feedback 👏:

### [“How does customer feedback impact your SaaS growth, retention, and development?”](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/getdolphinai_what-a-panel-its-about-connecting-activity-7220021429981884416-b5tl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

We split the event into two parts:

- A formal panel discussion.
- An informal drinks gathering.

I was an events director for over 10 years, and one of the things I love the most from hosting events is to greet people I don't know personally, making them feel at home, and building an experience that starts from the moment they book their ticket to the moment they go home after the event is finished.

##

**In essence, building a product and producing an event are almost the same thing.** You create magical experiences so that users (or guests) get *aha* moments continuously.

So we approached it in the same way we build Dolphin:

- Thinking about the user’s point of view. Who will the audience be?
- Trying to understand why they are coming to the event and what they are trying to take away from it.
- Planning every aspect of the evening to meet the needs and expectations of our attendees.

### The Outcome

Over 60 people coming together to share insights and experiences on startup building, focusing on how customer feedback impacts growth, retention, and revenue.

We had Founders. We had Customer Success Managers. Sales and GTM teams, Product Managers, and more.


**The panel was a dream come true:**

- [Anthony Rose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anrose/) (Founder & CEO [SeedLegals](https://seedlegals.com/) - the legaltech platform powering UK startups and a customer of Dolphin AI - & the man behind the BBC iPlayer).
- [Carmit Proper-Livni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmit-proper-livni/) (Customer Success Leader. EX-Gartner, Kaltura, DataRobot, causaLens).
- [Ines Abramovich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inesab/) (Revenue Operations & GTM advisor. Ex-Founder and Senior Director of Revenue Operations).

We had an honest discussion with learnings, and different points of view from Customer Success, Product, and Sales perspectives. 

**Here are our highlights:**

*👉 “Only 25% of sales teams are currently hitting their targets. And those who focus on customer feedback and their pain points, close 3x more.”*

*👉 “Don’t say yes to every request or feedback. Whether comes from the CEO or a customer (even a large one!), understand its short/long-term impact and prioritise it, especially from a revenue perspective.”*

*👉 “Saying no to a customer’s request is hard, but it’s sometimes inevitable. Closing the loop helps build trust, especially in B2B companies, where customers are partners in your growth.”*

*👉 “Feedback is essential for managing risks, identifying opportunities, and maintaining relationships. It helps us align our offerings with customer needs, measure satisfaction, gain insights for our product roadmap, and identify pain points and gaps.”*

*👉 “AI can help teams manage high volumes of data from different sources and formats effectively. Human analysis of such a large amount of data takes a lot of time and is prone to error."*

### The Pain of Customer Feedback

We heard plenty of times before starting Dolphin how annoying it is to make sense of customer feedback coming in from different sources (calls, support tickets, chat, surveys, etc.) and from different teams.

How long do teams spend today manually tagging this data on spreadsheets only to then share it with colleagues who need more context or ask, *“Why should I focus on this?”*

**Dolphin takes this process into 3 clicks:**

- Bringing your feedback data into one place.
- Setting up the Signals you care about (themes, categories, areas of the feedback).
- Using AI to find those insights for you, across all your feedback sources, 100x faster.
